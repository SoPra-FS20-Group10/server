#README Sopra FS20 Group 10: Scrabbar.io

Scrabbar.io is an online version of the famous board game Scrabble. Our game is
playable by 2-4 players and follows the original game's rules.

##Introduction

Hello there, we are a small group of university students who programmed this game
for a software engineering lab called Sopra. 

Our main goal for this project was to learn how to efficiently work in a group of
software developers. This includes communication, coordination and of course having
fun programming our game ;).

It was also very important to us that we have a game we can be proud of. This includes
having a frontend that is visually appealing, and a backend that works even when there
are faulty requests.

##Technologies used

For this project we used java to implement our server. In particular, we used Spring
for our web server and the wordnik API for our word validation system.

Additionally, we used Slack and Jira for communication and coordination of our team
and workload. Both products have been used hand-in-hand with our frontend team.
